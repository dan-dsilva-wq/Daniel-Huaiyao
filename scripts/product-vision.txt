## Project Vision

### What This Is
A private couples website for Daniel & Huaiyao - a collection of interactive mini-apps designed to keep their relationship playful, connected, and full of shared moments, whether they're together or apart.

### Why It Exists
It's nice to always have something to do when we're together or apart. This app creates little rituals and shared experiences:
- A gratitude wall to appreciate each other daily
- A collaborative story they write together, one sentence at a time
- A map of places they've been and want to go
- Mystery games they solve as a team
- A quiz to see how well they know each other
- Memories to look back on together

We're still missing more features to use when we're actually together.

It's not about productivity or metrics - it's about creating small moments of joy and connection.

### Design Philosophy

**1. Feel Alive, Not Static**
The app should feel like the other person is "there" even when they're not. This means:
- Real-time updates when your partner does something
- Typing indicators so you know they're present
- Push notifications that create anticipation
- "On this day" flashbacks to resurface shared memories
- Partner status showing what they're up to

**2. Low Friction, High Delight**
Every interaction should be effortless:
- No login/passwords - just pick who you are
- One-tap actions where possible
- Beautiful animations that feel responsive
- Mobile-first design (it's a PWA they use on their phones)

**3. Together, Not Competitive**
Features should bring them together, not pit them against each other:
- Joint achievements they unlock as a team
- Shared streaks (both need to participate)
- Collaborative features (story, mystery) over solo ones
- Stats show "us" not "me vs you"

**4. Gentle Nudges, Not Nagging**
Notifications should feel like a loving tap on the shoulder:
- "Huaiyao left you a note" (not "You haven't opened the app in 3 days!")
- Evening gratitude reminders only if neither has written
- Red dots for new content, not guilt-inducing streaks

**5. Personal and Evolving**
This is THEIR app, built for their specific relationship:
- Features based on what they actually enjoy
- Huaiyao can suggest changes via the feedback chat
- Inside jokes and personal touches welcome
- No need for generic "couple app" features they won't use
